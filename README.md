### **User Stories**

Users between 11 and 16 years old and older users are treated as the same because the only difference would be that the younger audience might 
have to learn what is provided by the application for grades and schools reasons while the older audience would not have this imperative. This 
does not affect the users stories significantly to be treated separately.

**As a first time user, I want:**

## Local Deployment

### Cloning

When a repository is created on GitHub, it is located on GitHub website ("remotely"). 
You can create a copy of the repository locally on your machine. This 
process is called : "**Cloning a repository**".  
When cloning a repository you are actually copying all the data that the repository 
contains at that time to your machine.

To clone a repository, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Click on the **Code** dropdown button above the files list.
3. There are three options available to clone the repository :
    * using HTTPS
    * using SSH key
    * using GitHub CLI  

![clone options](assets/images/README-images/deployment/cloning.png) ===> TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE PROJECT SO THE RIGHT REPO NAME APPEARS ON THE IMAGE

4. Choose an option and copy the link given.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
5. Open your IDE and in the CLI type : ```git clone``` and paste the link copied on step 4.
>```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```     
6. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

For further information please go to [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line).


### Using GitPod

To Clone a repository Using GitPod, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Install the GitPod [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) for Chrome 
or [Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/) for Firefox.
3. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
4. Click ont the **GitPod** button on the top right of the files list.
5. This will open a workspace on GitPod where you can work on the repository locally.

>The very first time that you do this, you need to connect GitPod and GitHub together.
You need to log in with GitHub and launch your workspace (As explain above). And then you need to
authorize GitPod to be able to access your GitHub account. You agree to GitPod's
terms and conditions, and then create a free account. Then, it will open the
workspace for you.
Quote from : "Creating a GitPod Workspace" on [Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Programme](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/), 
by Matt Rudge. 

### Using GitHub Desktop

An other option is available : GitHub Desktop. It consist of cloning a repository from GitHub 
to GitHub Desktop.  
For full information about how to use this option, please visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

### Forking

Forking a repository will copy it in your own repositories in GitHub.

>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. 
Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream 
repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork 
synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.

To Fork a repository take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
3. Identify the ```fork``` button on the top right of the page and click on it.

![forking](assets/images/README-images/deployment/fork.png) ===> TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE PROJECT SO THE RIGHT REPO NAME APPEARS ON THE IMAGE

4. Now you should find a copy of the repository in ```Your repositories```.
