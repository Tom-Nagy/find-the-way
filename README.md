#### Visit the live Website : **[Know It :arrow_right:](tom-nagy.github.io/know-it/)**.

Know It is a learning application that promotes curiosity and enjoyment in the process of acquiring knowledge. Its motto is: “Learning is cool and knowledge is great!”.
Know It is based on the fact that learning is easier when it is fun and entertaining; and we have fun when we play! The website proposes two platforms: a game and and study environment. They both are linked and related in their content, meaning that you can learn everything you need (and more!) to succeed and complete the game in the study environment.  
Different exciting and very cool topics are being treated. They all refer to the general and worldwide curriculum of children education, they appeal to everyone and reach the maximum of communities. The content is based on the syllabus of children between the age of 12 and 15 years old. At this stage of life knowledge is bursting, interesting and exciting. Children are learning about the World and how it functions.
It is the fundamentals and the foundation of the “grown up” knowledge. In this spirit it will attract many people from the young adolescence to no limit.
The application is published in English and will propose a French version as well (MAYBE).  
The subjects of the starting version of the application are all about the cool things that everyone is excited about:

* Volcano
* Ocean
* Jungle
* The Earth

The Earth is the compilation of all the subjects treated and more.  
They are amazing, entertaining, interesting and will be presented in the study environment in different sections as follow:

* Generals facts and Definitions
* How does it work?
* Fun Facts!
* Did you know ...

The game where the users will test their knowledge is a Labyrinth. Labyrinth are mesmerizing, intriguing and playful; that is why it is the perfect game to combine everything in an interactive and fun way.

[**:back:** *Table of Content*](#Table-of-Content)

### **User Stories**

Users between 11 and 16 years old and older users are treated as the same because the only difference would be that the younger audience might have to learn what is provided by the application for grades and schools reasons while the older audience would not have this imperative. This does not affect the users stories significantly to be treated separately.

**As a first time user, I want:**

1. The website to be appealing.
2. The navigation to be easy and intuitive.
3. The content to be informative but not overwhelming.
4. To understand immediately what is the website about without the need of looking for it.
5. To be able to choose the subject to study.
6. The content to be interactive.
7. To play the game.
8. The gameplay to be easy to understand.
9. To be able to choose a difficulty level for the game.
10. To be able to choose the subject of the game.
11. To create a profile to keep tract of my gaming score and progress.

**As a returning user, I want:**

1. To improve.
2. To check the different subjects.

### **Design Choices**

#### Fonts

In accordance with the developer/business goals and targeted audience, the fonts chosen for the websites are **Fredoka One**, **Handlee** and **Andika New Basic**.  

* Fredoka One will be used for headings. It is *display* font with a fun rounded style that matches perfectly with the website feel.  
* The Handlee is a *handwriting* font and will be used for the about page because it provides an informal and friendly display with a playful feel. This will bring a welcoming atmosphere to the page.

> Handlee is a great font for any web page looking to add some personality and charisma. There was careful attention to detail in removing unnecessary overlap between letters, which allows Handlee to be scaled down to very small sizes while still maintaining legibility.  
>[Handlee Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Handlee?query=handl#glyphs).

* Andika New Basic is a *sans serif* font designed for literacy use. That makes it the perfect font to present and display the content on the website.  

The fonts selected for this project have clear and defined shapes to support learning. They are not aggressive and provide a general friendly feel.

#### Icons

>"CHECK AND DOUBLE-CHECK THE LINKS..... ADD AND ADAPT THE CONTENT ...."

* FontAwesome icons will be used for better user experience.
* The logo and [favicon](assets/images/favicon/favicon.ico) are the same image to follow best practice and consistency.

![Logo](assets/images/logo/logo.png)

#### Colors

![Colour scheme](assets/images/README-images/colors/color.png)

The colours chosen for the website are bright and joyful. They are based on the psychology behind colours ([colour affects](http://www.colour-affects.co.uk/psychological-properties-of-colours), [London Image Institute](https://londonimageinstitute.com/how-to-empower-yourself-with-color-psychology/)). I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to create the colour scheme.

* Yellow for creativity and happiness.
* Orange for sociability and fun.
* Green for quality and growth.
* Purple for wisdom.

A blue will be used for displaying extra content as reference to competence and depth.
white will be used as background colour for cleanliness and simplicity.

The swatches are said to be color-blind safe by Adobe Color [accessibility tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility).

![Colour accessibility](assets/images/README-images/colors/color-accessibility.png)

#### Images

Images will be used for illustration purposes. They will help the representation of information in the study page of the website and are composed of pictures, drawings, schema and diagrams.

#### Styling and Feeling

The website is a learning platform that includes some content and a game. It uses bright and simple colours to provide the feeling of easy accessibility. It presents a clean, welcoming and trustworthy feel in order to bring quality information in a fun way!

### **Different Design**

"IF THE LIVE WEBSITE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WIREFRAMES"
Some designs are different from the wireframes because of user experience compliance, accessibility, technical skills and time.  

#### Site Map

"STRUCTURE OF THE WEBSITE IS DIFFERENT IN THIS AND THAT WAY BECAUSE ...."

[**:back:** *Table of Content*](#Table-of-Content)

## Features

The contact page is reachable from the menu or the about page.
It is intended not to be as obvious as the rest of the website because the main website audience is students and the contact page is mostly for teachers, schools, business etc.

The navigation menu is purposely “hidden” for focus reasons. It is a toggle on small screen and display on larger screen when the icon is hovered.  
This provides a cleaner and less busy viewport for the users. The goal being to avoid distractions.  
CONSIDER TOGGLE ON ALL SCREENS.  

When the player is activating the mechanism, a question pop up.
The question difficulty depends on the level played.

The check-box must be selected (only one at the time possible → radio button) and the button confirm answer clicked to send the answer.
Message should appear to guide the user if the confirm button is clicked with no answer selected.
Feedback on the answer should be given as well for right and wrong answer.

### **Existing Features**

#### Repeated Features

The **navigation bar** and the **footer** are present on all the pages except for the game page.

* The navigation bar:  
  * There is the website logo on the left that is linked to the home page for best practice.
  * The navigation menu is displayed as a toggle on all screen sizes in order to keep distractions to the minimum.

* The Footer:
  * On the left it will display the “copyright” *For educational use*.
  * On the right it will display some external links for additional information.

#### Home

The home page is composed of the main title: “**Welcome to Know It**” and a subtitle: “*Learning is fun and knowledge is great*”. As well, it displays a statement: Here learning is FUN!”. This welcome and invites users to discover the website and set the mood and feel of the website.  

It presents three buttons that link to the corresponding page:

As well a paragraph offers users to reach out to the website owner with a secondary button:

* Contact

#### Study

This page presents some learning content.  
It is composed of a title to explain how to proceed: “To choose a subject, click on it!”; and a subtitle to present a feature of the page inviting users to look for  magnifiers in order to discover more information about a section.  

Four icons are displayed and represent the subject available to study. The fourth one being the compiled version of the other ones:

* Volcano
* Jungle
* Ocean
* Earth

The volcano subject will be preloaded.

#### Play

The page presents a title inviting to play: “Let's play!”.  
As well is displayed the steps to follow in order to set up a party.  
There is an invitation to go to the study room in order to refresh our memory with a button linked to the corresponding page.  
You will find a *How to play?* link that triggers a pop-up with the rules and more precise information on the game.  

The interface to set up the party is composed of a **dropdown menu** to set the level, a **carousel** to display the subject's icons on one line and a button: “**Play**” to start the game. This protocol provide users an overview of the settings and choices made before to start to play.

#### Game

The game interface is composed of:

* The game area in the middle → the labyrinth.
* The control buttons on the bottom. They are four directional arrows.
* A New game button on the top right to start a new game with the same configuration.
* An Exit button on the top right to go back to the play page.
* The icon corresponding to the subject selected on the top left.
* The level difficulty corresponding to the level selected on the top left.

The gameplay is as follow:  
You will move the avatar through the labyrinth in order to reach the exit. The access to the exit is blocked and in order progress through the labyrinth you will need to activate some mechanism. They are accessible via a special panel easily recognizable.  
Once you reached the panel you will have to answer a multiple choices question.  
If you get it right you will gain access to another part of the labyrinth.  
If you get it wrong you will get a strike, but you will be able to guess again.  
The number of strikes allowed are determined by the level difficulty of the party.  
The questions appear as pop-up. There you will have to select one answer and validate your answer.
Will you be able to get out?

#### Contact

## Local Deployment

### Cloning

When a repository is created on GitHub, it is located on GitHub website (“remotely”). You can create a copy of the repository locally on your machine. This process is called : “**Cloning a repository**”.  
When cloning a repository you are actually copying all the data that the repository contains at that time to your machine.

To clone a repository, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Click on the **Code** dropdown button above the files list.
3. There are three options available to clone the repository :
    * using HTTPS
    * using SSH key
    * using GitHub CLI  

![clone options](assets/images/README-images/deployment/cloning.png)

4. Choose an option and copy the link given.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Open your IDE and in the CLI type : ```git clone``` and paste the link copied on step 4.

>```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```

7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

For further information please go to [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line).

### Using GitPod

To Clone a repository Using GitPod, take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Install the GitPod [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) for Chrome or [Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/) for Firefox.
3. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
4. Click on the **GitPod** button on the top right of the files list.
5. This will open a workspace on GitPod where you can work on the repository locally.

>The very first time that you do this, you need to connect GitPod and GitHub together. You need to log in with GitHub and launch your workspace (As explain above). And then you need to authorize GitPod to be able to access your GitHub account. You agree to GitPod's terms and conditions, and then create a free account. Then, it will open the workspace for you.
Quote from : “Creating a GitPod Workspace” on [Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Programme](https://codeinstitute.net/full-stack-software-development-diploma/), by Matt Rudge.

### Using GitHub Desktop

Another option is available : GitHub Desktop. It consists of cloning a repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop.  
For full information about how to use this option, please visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop).

### Forking

Forking a repository will copy it in your own repositories in GitHub.

>A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.

To Fork a repository take the following steps :

1. Create a GitHub account.
2. Navigate to the corresponding repository.
3. Identify the ```fork``` button on the top right of the page and click on it.

![Forking](assets/images/README-images/deployment/fork.png)

4. Now you should find a copy of the repository in ```Your repositories```.
