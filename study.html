        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
          Volcanoes have different shapes and forms. Some look like mountains
          (<em>cone like shape</em>) from which molten rocks and gas can
          erupt. In simple words, it is an opening through the Earth crust.
          <br />
          When a volcano in not in eruption, everything is happening inside
          it. But what is going on in there?

          <p>
            Volcanoes are formed when hot liquid, molten rocks and gas, known
            as magma is forced to the surface of the earth by natural forces
            such as temperature and pressure. During this process the land
            around the column of magma rises to form the shape of the
            volcano<br />
            Most of the volcanoes are situated close to the tectonic plates boundaries.
            But they can appear other places too.

        </div>
        <p>
          Our loved planet Earth is not solid everywhere! And volcanoes are
          proof of it. As you can see on the illustration, we live on a the
          outer part of the planet called the <strong>crust</strong>. It is
          about 35 kilometers thick and the thinnest layer. Deeper within the
          Earth and surrounding the planet's core is a liquid layer called the
          <strong>outer core</strong>. The <strong>mantle</strong> (<em>composed of the upper and lower mantle</em>)
          sometimes produces the <strong>magma</strong> that flows out of the volcanoes
          as <strong>lava</strong>.
        </p>

        <h5>The Movements</h5>

        <p>
          The crust is not one solid piece. In fact if it were, we might not
          have any volcanoes! Indeed the crust (<em>composed of the oceanic crust and continental crust</em>) moves with
          the tectonic plates.<br />
          The tectonic plates form the lithosphere. They are huge section of
          rocks that are constantly moving. Where those plates meet the
          friction creates a lot of energy with very hight temperature and
          pressure. Cracks form and the magma can emerged from a
          <strong>magma chamber</strong> producing a volcano.<br />
          Although volcanoes are mostly found at the contact of two tectonic
          plates, they are also found away from those plates boundaries in
          <strong>hotspots</strong> zones. Hotspots are formed when very hot
          magma makes its way through the crust. They happen when magma is
          especially hot and the conditions are extreme.
        </p>

        <button class="magnifier"  aria-label="Toggle extra content.">

        </button>
        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            You can think of the tectonic plates as giant pieces of puzzle
            that cover the Earth. They never stop moving but it is so slow we
            can't feel it. They progress at the rate of a couple of
            centimeters (<em>between 3 and 5cms</em>) a year!
          </p>
          
          <span>
            The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic
            boundaries:
          </span>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Convergent</strong>, when plates move toward one another
              (also known as subduction). They can form mountain ranges like
              the Himalaya and the mount Everest (that keep growing over
              time), or trenches like the Mariana Trench in the North Pacific
              Ocean (deepest point on Earth)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Divergent</strong>, when plates move away from one
              another. In the ocean this process widen the oceanic floor and
              create a ridge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transform</strong>, when plates move alongside one
              another. They grind each other and create devastating
              earthquake.
            </li>

        <p>
          Volcanoes appear in different sizes and variety. We can find four
          basic types that are characterized by the lava flow.<br />
          The lava composition ranges from very liquid to very viscous and
          influences directly the lava flow.<br />
        </p>

        <span> The volcano types: </span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Shield volcano</strong> are the result of liquid lava
            emitted from a central vent. The low viscosity lava flows rapidly
            over long distance forming the shield like shape volcano. Their
            gentle slopes usually don't exceed 10 degrees.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Composite volcano</strong> also known as
            <strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong> are the result of more viscous
            lava emitted from a main central vent and secondary side vents.
            The medium to hight viscosity lava flows slowly forming steeper
            slopes. Over time the hight density lava hardening rapidly builds
            up rising the hight of the volcano. They can explode with a great
            violence from the main vent as well as the side vents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dome volcano</strong> are the result of very viscous lava
            emitted from a central vent. The hight viscosity lava flows very
            slowly cooling and hardening when it reaches the surface. This
            phenomena create a dome like shape around and over the vent
            blocking the eruption. Sometimes when the pressure gets hight
            enough it produces violent eruption blowing the dome into pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Caldera volcano</strong> are the result of viscous lava
            emitted from different vent that form over time. They form after a
            volcanic eruption empties a deep magma chamber causing the surface
            to collapse. This creates a crater like shape called caldera. They
            can be up to 50 kilometers wide. Over time the magma chamber can
            fill with magma again rising the caldera floor. It may stay like
            this or create another eruption reshaping the caldera and know as
            a <strong>resurgent caldera</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Different Types of Eruptions:</h4>
        <span> Volcanic eruptions can be of two types: </span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Explosive eruption</strong> is characterized by violent
            emissions of gas, ashes and rocks in the atmosphere (<em>known as volcanic bomb</em>).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Effusive eruption</strong> is characterized by outpouring
            of lava, relatively low in viscosity and gas, without significant
            explosion.
          </li>
        </ul>

        </button>
        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            In more detailed classification volcanic eruptions are are of six
            types of increasing degree of explosiveness:<br />
            They are characterized by their volcanic activity types and
            location that are very often linked.<br />
            <strong>Icelandic</strong> is an effusive type with very liquid
            lava outpouring from long parallel fissures often building lava
            plateaus.<br />
            <strong>Hawaiian</strong> is similar to the Icelandic type except
            that the lava is flowing from the summit of a volcano creating
            shield volcanoes.<br />
            <strong>Strombolian</strong> is an effusive type with few outburst
            of ga creating relatively small explosions.<br />
            <strong>Vulcanian</strong> type involves moderate explosions
            creating plume cloud.<br />
            <strong>Pelean</strong> is an explosive type with low viscosity
            lava, pyroclastic flows and very violent explosions and
            destructive eruptions.<br />
            <strong>Plinian</strong> is the most intense and destructive of
            all. With a highly gas rich magma it creates enormous explosion
            and ejects a huge quantity of gas and volcanic fragments into the
            sky forming a devastating eruption cloud. It can be produced for
            several hours and rise up to the stratosphere (<em>about 10 kilometers hight</em>).
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            About 90% of all active volcanoes are located in the Pacific Ring
            of Fire(<em>where the Pacific plate meets other surrounding tectonic
              plates</em>).
          </li>
          <li>
            More than 80% of the external part of the Earth crust is made of
            basaltic rocks formation resulting of lava eruptions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lava creates glass called obsidian. It is a very strong rock with
            edges sharper than steel usually black and used for weaponry by
            our ancestors.
          </li>
          <li>
            The hottest lava made of basalt can reach temperatures as hight as
            1170 celsius degree. It is hot enough to melt any kind of metal
            and rocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cloud produced by a volcano is not smoke but ash. Ash created
            by volcanoes is made of immensely hot gas, lava and rocks
            shattered into tiny pieces as small as two millimeters and
            extremely dangerous.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volcanic ash is very dangerous for airplanes causing engines
            problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Volcanic lightning can appear during an eruption. It is caused by
            the friction of the small fragments present in the volcanic ash
            cloud generating static electricity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The asthenosphere act as a giant moving belt induced by convection
            movement of temperatures and magma making the tectonic plates
            move.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hotspots can create what is called a volcanic chain. The magma
            erupting creates a volcano and while the tectonic plates are
            moving, new volcanoes are created. This repeating process creates
            the volcanic chain.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth. It is
            mostly under water and created by periodic eruptions.

        <h3 class="heading">Jungle</h3>

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
          Jungle is a generic term that refers to a dense forest generally
          where the weather is hot.<br />
          (<em>Jungles are very similar to rainforests but are very slightly
            different. In this study we will consider them the same and use
            both names interchangeably as they share the same features</em>).<br />
          It is characterized by a dense tangled vegetation with an extensive
          biodiversity.<br />
          Jungles are one of the most important habitat on Earth and largely
          contribute in sustaining the Earth's ecosystem as we know it.<br />
          while each rainforest is unique, they all share common features.

          <p>
            Jungles are mostly situated in the tropics, subtropics and around
            the equator. This type of forest host an incredible biodiversity.
            It is though that over 50% of the plants and animals on earth live
            in the rainforest.<br />
            It covers about 4% of the Earth surface and 12% of the land
            surface in 2020. it plays an important role in the Earth's
            ecosystem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>

        <h5>Climate</h5>

        <p>
          Jungles precipitation is one of the highest on the globe. It
          fluctuate between 200 and 600 centimeters of rain a year.<br />
          The humidity is very high and average around 80%.<br />
          It never froze in the jungle. In fact, the lowest temperature is
          rarely below 20 celsius degrees and the highest rarely above 35
          celsius degrees.<br />
          This create a hot and steamy climate that works like a greenhouse
          and is the perfect environment for the forest to develop. It is
          <strong>equable</strong>: with not much variation.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          Jungles are structured in four layers. Each level has unique
          characteristics corresponding to an habitat with different
          quantities of sunlight, water and air circulation. They are
          interdependent and influence one another.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The Emergent Layer</strong> is the top layer of the
            forest. Trees dominate with a hight reaching 60 meters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Canopy Layer</strong> is beneath the emergent layer.
            It is about 6 meters of dense vegetation with a huge network of
            branches and leaves forming a roof over the remaining layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Understory Layer</strong> is a dark and more humid
            environment. Vegetation usually develop large leaves in order to
            catch the remaining sunlight reaching through the canopy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Forest Floor</strong> is the darkest part of the
            jungle making it difficult for the vegetation to grow. In this
            environment everything decays rapidly forming what is called the
            <strong>humus</strong>. It is the food factory for the trees of
            the jungle producing nutrients and hosting a thriving animal life.
            The humus layer is very thin making the ground poor in nutrients.
            For this reason the trees develop very shallow and widespread
            roots called <strong>buttress roots</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <button class="magnifier"  aria-label="Toggle extra content.">
          <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            In the jungle trees are mostly evergreen.<br />
            In the canopy and above, animals move through the vegetation by
            flying or gliding. Those animals are usually small so their weight
            is supported by the most fragile branches.<br />
            With a particularly rich availability in food, the canopy is home
            to more animals than any other layers. It is estimated that the
            canopy host more than 50% of the life in the rainforest.<br />
            Understory plants often produce large and colorful flowers with a
            strong sent in order to attract pollinators in the darkest parts
            of the jungle.<br />
            When rivers run through the jungle, they create an unusual
            freshwater habitat on the forest floor. For example, the Amazon
            river is home to one of the few freshwater dolphin in the world.
          </p>

        <h5>Ecosystem and Biodiversity</h5>

        <p>
          The rainforests have the most important terrestrial biodiversity on
          Earth.<br />
          They are located in tropical regions and receive a lot of sunlight.
          The sunlight provide energy for the vegetation which is transmitted
          to all the living organisms of the jungle through the
          <strong>food chain</strong>.
          <br />
          The canopy structure provides an abundance of places for plants to
          grow and animals to live. It offers resources such as food and
          shelter that leads to interaction and interdependence of the species
          that live there.<br />
          The jungle is a very competitive place, with species developing
          incredible strategies and innovations to survive, encouraging
          <strong>specialization</strong>.
        </p>

        <button class="magnifier"  aria-label="Toggle extra content.">
          <i class="fas fa-search-plus"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            The jungle is home to an incredible biodiversity such as plants
            that only grow on other trees called
            <strong>epiphytes</strong>.<br />
            The climate present in the jungle allow organisms to grow at a
            very quick pace. And because the competition between plants is
            very hard and their environment harsh plants developed poisonous
            toxins to protect themselves from the fauna.<br />
            Some of the most known, mesmerizing and mystifying animals present
            in the jungle are jaguars, tigers, elephants, gorillas, monkeys,
            eagles and snakes that live in the trees or on the forest floor.
            But as well the climate their is ideal for insects such as bees,
            butterflies, termites, flies and ants. One particular species of
            ants called the <strong>army ant</strong> are nomads like! They
            have no nest and march in line everyday to hunt for food. When the
            night comes, they come together and form a nest around their queen
            by hooking on each other.

        <h4>The Importance of the Jungle:</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>Provide home to an immense diversity of plants and animals.</li>
          <li>
            Participate greatly in the water cycle by receiving, stocking and
            providing a huge quantity of fresh water. More than 50% of the
            precipitation it received is returned by transpiration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Help to maintain the Earth ecosystem by absorbing carbon dioxide,
            reducing the impact of the greenhouse gas emissions. As well it
            produces 20% of our oxygen and absorbs solar radiation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protect against flood, erosion and drought with its unique climate
            and ecosystem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide resources for food, medicine and economy like fruits,
            coffee, chocolate, bananas, brazil nuts, rubber, tapioca, wood
            etc.

        </div>

        <p>
          Deforestation is happening at an alarming pace. It is mainly due to
          human activity. Many scientist predict that the rainforest will lose
          between 5 and 10% of their species every decade. It would destruct
          its habitats in a near future.<br />
          This is one of the biggest challenge humanity is facing.<br />
          On the bright side, there are a lot of people invested and wanting
          to save the rainforests.
        </p>

        <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>About 25% of the medicines come from the jungle.</li>
          <li>
            The Brazil nut tree (<em>a vulnerable species</em>) can live up to
            1,000 years.
          </li>
          <li>Only 2% of the light is reaching the forest floor.</li>
          <li>
            A lot of plants in the humid climate of the rainforest canopy have
            developed leaves with pointy tips called
            <strong>drip tips</strong> so the water does not stay on the
            leaves avoiding the development of fungus.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the forest floor layer of the jungle is very humid and
            still, the top layer (<em>the emergent layer</em>) is the dryest.
          </li>
          <li>
            It can take up to 10 minutes for a drop of rain water to fall on
            the floor of the rainforest.
          </li>
          <li>
            The largest rainforest is the Amazon, situated in South America

        <h4>Definition:</h4>
        <p>
          An Ocean is a large body of salted water. There is only one global ocean
          that covers 71% of the Earth surface. All the water it contains is
          connected.<br />
          For convenience and political reasons, oceanographers geographically
          divided the Ocean into five recognized basins.<br />
          Historically there are 4 ocean basins: the Pacific, the Atlantic,
          the Indian and the Arctic. However nowadays a fifth basins is
          recognized by most of the countries: the Arctic basin.
        </p>

          <p>
            Ocean formed billions of years ago when the Earth temperature
            cooled below 100 Celsius degree. The water state changed from gas
            to water by condensing into rain. Over a long period of time it
            filled the basin that we call ocean.<br />
            It is commonly said that the colour of the ocean is given by the
            sky but in reality the colour of the ocean is blue-green. In fact,
            the water absorbs colours in the red spectrum of light reflecting
            the colours that we see. This is observable over a large quantity
            of water.<br />
            The salt in the ocean comes from two sources: the runoff or
            erosion of the land and openings in the ocean floor. Rocks on the
            land are the main source of salts we find in the ocean water.
            Rainfall and rivers that erodes the rocks on the land dissolved
            them and carry minerals to the seas. While some of the minerals
            are used by organisms found in the water, others are not. Over
            time this process generates an increase in their concentration
            making the ocean salty.

          The boundaries of the ocean are mainly defined by surrounding lands.
          They include all the seas within their area.<br />
          <strong>The Pacific Ocean</strong> is the largest one and extends
          from the Antarctic region in the South to the Arctic region in the
          North and from Asia and Australia in the west to America in the
          East.<br />
          <strong>The Atlantic Ocean</strong> is the second largest and
          extends from the Antarctic region in the South to the Arctic region
          in the North and from America in the West to Europe and Africa in
          the East.<br />
          <strong>The Indian Ocean</strong> is the third largest and extends
          from the Antarctic region in the South to Asia in the North and from
          Africa in the West to Australia in the East.<br />
          <strong>The Southern or Antarctic Ocean</strong> is formed by
          combining the south parts od the previous ocean. It basically
          extends all around the Antarctic in a circular form.<br />
          <strong>The Arctic Ocean</strong> is the smallest and is mainly
          delimited by the North border of the continents that surround it.

        <h4>How Does It Work?</h4>

        <h5>Tides:</h5>
        <div class="images-container">
          <!-- Image by brgfx from [freepik](https://www.freepik.com):

        </div>

        <p>
          Tides are the periodic variation of the sea level caused by
          gravitational forces. They are caused by the gravitational pull of
          the moon and the sun.<br />
          It corresponds to the rise and fall of the sea level on the coast.
          Tides fluctuate between high and low. The difference between the two
          is called <strong>tidal range</strong>. It defines the
          <strong>intertidal zone</strong>, a particularly important
          ecological feature of the tides.
        </p>

        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            Almost everywhere on Earth there are two tides a day. They each
            have a high point (<em>the high tide</em>) and a low point (<em>the low tide</em>).<br />
            When the tide is going toward the hight tide, it is called a
            <strong>flood tide</strong>. And when the tide is going towards
            the low tide, it is called an <strong>ebb tide</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h5>Currents:</h5>

        <p>
          Ocean current is a continuous movement of water. They are created
          by wind, water temperature, salinity and tides. They can be found on
          the surface of the ocean or deep down below.<br />
          Close to the surface, the currents are widely affected by the wind.
          Deeper, the currents are affected by temperature, pressure and
          salinity.
        </p>

        <div class="extra-info hide">
          <p>
            The ocean is never still. While the currents move the water from
            one place to another, waves are often seen on the surface of the
            water but they do not move the water. Waves are commonly created
            by the wind (but not only) and transmit energy called
            <strong>kinetic energy</strong>.<br />
            <strong>Rogue waves</strong> are waves that appear without being
            expected and have a size of more than twice of the prevailing
            condition.

        <p>
          Water is essential for life on Earth and the water cycle describes
          its existence and movements on the planet.<br />
          Water on Earth is present in different states: liquid, vapor and
          ice.<br />
          The Water on Earth is not new and is part of the cycle ever since it
          existed which means that the water you drink today might have been
          part of the snow cap of the Everest at one stage of its life!
        </p>

        <span>Stages of the water cycle:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The sun evaporates water from the ocean: water changes state from
            liquid to vapor.
          </li>
          <li>
            As the vapor rises into the atmosphere it cools down and the vapor
            condensate: water changes state from vapor to liquid forming
            clouds.
          </li>
          <li>
            The clouds move the air current and keep charging with more water
            that falls back on Earth as precipitations in the state of liquid
            or solid (rain, snow or ice).
          </li>
          <li>
            In cold climate the water is found in the solid state as snow or
            ice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Snow and ice can melt and flow into rivers changing state from
            solid to liquid.
          </li>
          <li>
            Snow and ice can as well directly evaporate into the air changing
            state from solid to vapor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rainfall and water flow from ice and snow run down and supply or
            create lakes, rivers and ocean.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some of the flowing water goes underground by infiltration
            becoming groundwater.
          </li>
          <li>Some groundwater can flow to the surface as springs.</li>
          <li>
            Plants take and use groundwater that then evaporate by
            transpiration from their leaves into the air.
          </li>
          <li>
            Groundwater can form some reserve very deep into the ground and
            can flow into the ocean.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Importance of The Ocean:</h4>
        <p>
          The Ocean produces over 50% of the world oxygen and absorbs 50 times
          more carbon dioxide than our atmosphere.<br />
          It plays an important role in the climate regulation by transporting
          heat from the equator to the poles.<br />
          It is an immense resource for food and economy. The ocean provides
          salt, fish, crustacean, seaweed minerals and energy from fossil
          energy to renewable energy.<br />
          Covering most part of our planet, it is hugely used for
          transportation.
        </p>

        <h4>Ocean Life:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Plankton</strong> are mostly microscopic organisms drifting
          and carried by the current and the tides in the ocean and unable to
          swim against them. It comes from the Greek for “wandering,
          drifting”. It comprises phytoplankton and zooplankton. Plankton has
          an important place in the food chain and ecosystem of the ocean.<br />
          <strong>Phytoplankton</strong> are microscopic plants. They are the
          main producer of oxygen performing the photosynthesis and are found
          close to the surface.<br />
          <strong>Zooplankton</strong> are microscopic animals including
          krill, sea snail etc.<br />
          <br />
          The ocean is home to some incredible species from the seahorse to
          the narwhals (the unicorns of the ocean). They include seaweed,
          seagrass, mangrove, cephalopods, crustacean, corals, marine mammals,
          fish, sea turtles, reptiles and seabirds.<br />
          The ocean ecosystems hugely vary from the fjjords in Scandinavia to
          sandy beach.
        </p>

        <h4>Interesting Facts:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>More than 80% of the ocean is unexplored.</li>
          <li>More than 90% of the total water on Earth is in the Ocean.</li>
          <li>
            The Pacific Ocean cover more than 30% of the Earth’s surface.
          </li>
          <li>All the Earth land surface would fit in the Pacific Ocean.</li>
          <li>Life began in the Ocean over 3.5 billion years ago.</li>
          <li>
            Water takes about 1000 years to travel all the way around the
            globe.
          </li>
          <li>
            The deepest part of the ocean is the Marina Trench at more than 10
            kilometers deep.
          </li>
          <li>The mid-ocean ridge is nearly 65,000 kilometers long.</li>
          <li>
            The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the largest living organism
            on Earth and can be seen from the Moon.
          </li>
          <li>
            The coral reef represents only 1/50 of the marine floor.<br />
            1/4 of marine life find its home in the coral reef.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Gulf Stream transport more water than all the Earth’s rivers
            combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            The coelacanth, a fish thought to be extinct and leaving in the
            ocean 300 million years ago was caught by a fisherman off the
            south coast of Africa.
          </li>
          <li>The Indian ocean is the warmest ocean.</li>
          <li>Tsunami waves can travel as fast as a jet plane.</li>
          <li>
            The largest rogue waves recorded happened on the west of the coast
            of Scotland and presented waves with a height reaching almost 30
            meters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some research shows that if all the salt from the ocean would be
            spread evenly on the Earth land surface, it would cover it all and
            build up over 150 meters high.
