          <h5>Definition:</h5>
          <p>
            Volcanoes have different shapes and forms. Some look like mountains
            (<em>cone like shape</em>) from which molten rocks and gaz can
            erupt. In simple words, it is an opening through the Earth crust.
            <br />
            When a volcano in not in eruption, everything is happening inside
            it. But what is going on in there?

            <p>
              Volcanoes are formed when hot liquid, molten rocks and gaz, known
              as magma is forced to the surface of the earth by natural forces
              such as temperature and pressure. During this process the land
              around the column of magma rises to form the shape of the
              volcano<br />
              Most of the volcanoes are situated where two tectonic plates
              collide. But they can appear other places too.

          <p>
            Our loved planet Earth is not solid everywhere! And volcanoes are
            proof of it. As you can see on the illustration, we live on a the
            outer part of the planet called the <strong>crust</strong>. It is
            about 35 kilometers thick and the thinnest layer. Deeper within the
            Earth and surrounding the planet's core is a liquid layer called the
            <strong>outer core</strong>. The <strong>mantle</strong> sometimes
            produces the <strong>magma</strong> that flows out of the volcanoes
            as <strong>lava</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The crust is not one solid piece. In fact if it were, we might not
            have any volcanoes! Indeed the crust (<em
              >composed of the oceanic crust and continental crust</em
            >) moves with the tectonic plates.<br />
            The tectonic plates form the lithosphere. They are huge section of
            rocks that are constantly moving. Where those plates meet the
            friction creates a lot of energy with very hight temperature and
            pressure. Cracks form and the magma can emerged from a
            <strong>magma chamber</strong> producing a volcano.<br />
            Although volcanoes are mostly found at the contact of two tectonic
            plates, they are also found away from those plates boundaries in
            <strong>hotspots</strong> zones. Hotspots are formed when very hot
            magma makes its way through the crust. They happen when magma is
            especially hot and the conditions are extreme.
          </p>

            <p>
              You can think of the tectonic plates as giant pieces of puzzle
              that cover the Earth. They never stop moving but it is so slow we
              can't feel it. They progress at the rate of a couple of
              centimeters (<em>between 3 and 5cms</em>) a year!

            <ul>
              <span>
                The movement of the plates creates three types of tectonic
                boundaries:
              </span>
              <li>
                <strong>Convergent</strong>, when plates move toward one another
                (also known as subduction). They can form mountain ranges like
                the Himalaya and the mount Everest (that keep growing over
                time), or trenches like the Mariana Trench in the North Pacific
                Ocean (deepest point on Earth)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Divergent</strong>, when plates move away from one
                another. In the ocean this process widen the oceanic floor and
                create a ridge.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transform</strong>, when plates move alongside one
                another. They grind each other and create devastating
                earthquake.
              </li>

          <p>
            Volcanoes appear in different sizes and variety. We can find four
            basic types that are characterized by the lava flow.<br />
            The lava composition ranges from very liquid to very viscous and
            influences directly the lava flow.<br />
          </p>
          <ul>
            <span> The volcano types: </span>
            <li>
              <strong>Shield volcano</strong> are the result of liquid lava
              emitted from a central vent. The low viscosity lava flows rapidly
              over long distance forming the shield like shape volcano. Their
              gentle slopes usually don't exceed 10 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Composite volcano</strong> also known as
              <strong>Stratovolcanoes</strong> are the result of more viscous
              lava emitted from a main central vent and secondary side vents.
              The medium to hight viscosity lava flows slowly forming steeper
              slopes. Over time the hight density lava hardening rapidly builds
              up rising the hight of the volcano. They can explode with a great
              violence from the main vent as well as the side vents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dome volcano</strong> are the result of very viscous lava
              emitted from a central vent. The hight viscosity lava flows very
              slowly cooling and hardening when it reaches the surface. This
              phenomena create a dome like shape around and over the vent
              blocking the eruption. Sometimes when the pressure gets hight
              enough it produces violent eruption blowing the dome into pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Caldera volcano</strong> are the result of viscous lava
              emitted from different vent that form over time. They form after a
              volcanic eruption empties a deep magma chamber causing the surface
              to collapse. This creates a crater like shape called caldera. They
              can be up to 50 kilometers wide. Over time the magma chamber can
              fill with magma again rising the caldera floor. It may stay like
              this or create another eruption reshaping the caldera and know as
              a <strong>resurgent caldera</strong>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <span> Volcanic eruptions can be of two types: </span>
            <li>
              <strong>Explosive eruption</strong> is characterized by violent
              emissions of gaz, ashes and rocks in the atmosphere (<em
                >known as volcanic bomb</em
              >).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Effusive eruption</strong> is characterized by outpouring
              of lava, relatively low in viscosity and gaz, without significant
              explosion.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <p>
              In more detailed classification volcanic eruptions are are of six
              types of increasing degree of explosiveness:<br />
              They are characterized by their volcanic activity types and
              location that are very often linked.
              <strong>Icelandic</strong> is an effusive type with very liquid
              lava outpouring from long parallel fissures often building lava
              plateaus.<br />
              <strong>Hawaiian</strong> is similar to the Icelandic type except
              that the lava is flowing from the summit of a volcano creating
              shield volcanoes.<br />
              <strong>Strombolian</strong> is an effusive type with few outburst
              of ga creating relatively small explosions.<br />
              <strong>Vulcanian</strong> type involves moderate explosions
              creating plume cloud.<br />
              <strong>Pelean</strong> is an explosive type with low viscosity
              lava, pyroclastic flows and very violent explosions and
              destructive eruptions.<br />
              <strong>Plinian</strong> is the most intense and destructive of
              all. With a highly gas rich magma it creates enormous explosion
              and ejects a huge quantity of gas and volcanic fragments into the
              sky forming a devastating eruption cloud. It can be produced for
              several hours and rise up to the stratosphere (<em
                >about 10 kilometers hight</em
              >).

          <h5>Interesting Facts:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              About 90% of all active volcanoes are located in the Pacific Ring
              of Fire(<em
                >where the Pacific plate meets other surrounding tectonic
                plates</em
              >).
            </li>

              More than 80% 2 of the external part of the Earth crust is made of
              basaltic rocks formation resulting of lava eruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lava creates glass called obsidian. It is a very strong rock with
              edges sharper than steel usually black and used for weaponry by
              our ancestors.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hottest lava made of basalt can reach temperatures as hight as
              1170 celsius degree. It is hot enough to melt any kind of metal
              and rocks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The cloud produced by a volcano is not smoke but ash. Ash created
              by volcanoes is made of immensely hot gas, lava and rocks
              shattered into tiny pieces as small as two millimeters and
              extremely dangerous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volcanic ash is very dangerous for airplanes causing engines
              problems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volcanic lightning can appear during an eruption. It is caused by
              the friction of the small fragments present in the volcanic ash
              cloud generating static electricity.
            </li>
            <li>
              The asthenosphere act as a giant moving belt induced by convection
              movement of temperatures and magma making the tectonic plates
              move.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hotspots can create what is called a volcanic chain. The magma
              erupting creates a volcano and while the tectonic plates are
              moving, new volcanoes are created. This repeating process creates
              the volcanic chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth. It is
              mostly under water and created by periodic eruptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Volcanic eruption can create lahars devastating everything on its
              way.

          <h5>Scientific Terms:</h5>

          <ul class="scientific-terms">
            <li>
              <strong>Active volcano</strong>: A volcano that has erupted at
              least once in the pas 10,000 years and is expected to erupt again.
              It can be erupting or dormant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Magma</strong>: Mixed of gas and molten rocks below the
              Earth's surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lava</strong>: Magma that reaches the Earth's surface.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pyroclastic flow</strong>: A turbulent and very fast
              moving very hot mixture of gas and ash erupted from a volcano. It
              can reach a speed that often exceed 80 kilometers per hour with a
              temperature that ranges between 200 and 700 celsius degrees. It is
              extremely devastating.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lahar</strong>: A fast moving mudflow made of volcanic ash
              and water. It can consume and incorporate anything in its way and
              grow more than 10 times its initial size. In steep areas it can
              exceed 200 kilometers per hour.
